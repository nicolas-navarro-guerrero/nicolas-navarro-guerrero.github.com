<p>Supported by a Semper Ardens Grant of the Carlsberg Foundation, an international project group of 25 researchers from 11 disciplines will work out the methodological foundations of “Integrative Social Robotics” (ISR) and implement it for the first time. “Integrative Social Robotics” (ISR) is a new strategy for developing social robotics applications—it tighly integrates robotics research with a wide scope of research disciplines that investigate human social interactions, including empirical, conceptual, and value-theoretic research in the Humanities.</p>

<p>The project  team will design and test several innovative social robotics applications that promote socio-cultural values and norms of personal well-being, such as fairness, authenticity, autonomy, and creative self-realization.</p>

<p>The INSOR project is coordinated by the Research Unit for Robophilosophy (R.U.R) at Aarhus University.</p>
