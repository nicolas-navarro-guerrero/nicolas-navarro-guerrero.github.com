<p>On 2008, I and two friends developed as freelance project an autonomous vision system for the classification of different grape varieties. The devices are able to identify 9 different grape varieties while they move on a conveyor belt. The output information is transmitted to a PLC via a serial protocol. Development of hardware (electronic and mechanics) and software for 8 devices were integrally completed by us within a 5 months window. Within the same year we build 8 additional devices.</p>
