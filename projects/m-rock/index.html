<p>M-RoCK is part of the X-RoCK developments, enabling users to design personal assistants without any expert knowledge and help domain experts to identify opportunities to improve a system. M-RoCK builds on the results of D-RoCK and Q-RoCK: Modularization and modelling solutions developed in D-RoCK enable efficient reuse of components and describe how components can be used in a given context. Q-RoCK automatically maps the structural hardware and software complexity of current robotic systems to behaviours. The main goal of M-RoCK is to enable the use of user feedback to not only improve behaviours on the software side with respect to the individual requirements of the user, as shown in the Q-RoCK outlook, but also to realize a subsequent optimization of the Q-RoCK software flow with respect to the hardware selection. M-RoCK thus enables an automatic adaptation of a robot to the individual requirements and preferences of the interacting human. For this purpose, explicit feedback (e.g., a rating scale for performance evaluation) is combined with implicit feedback. As a source of implicit human feedback, M-RoCK makes use of the EEGs of the users. Using two different rating scenarios, we evaluate the developments in M-RoCK to validate that both laymen and domain experts can use them.</p>
