  abstract = {In this thesis work has been undertaken to determine what constitutes normal eye behavior, for humans during conversation along with work to determine,live, what kind of gaze a human expresses. These two pieces of information are then used to construct an algorithm that can let a robot or virtual avatar act like a human in a conversation.
It was found that normal behavior varies from culture to culture and person to person and as such ``normal'' behavior cannot be unanimously defined. Furthermore it was found that while rulebased determination of gaze types are viable, the current implementation has several shortcomings. The implemented prototype circumvents the cultural problem by imitating the participant and thus always match the culture and the perceived intimacy of the conversation.},
