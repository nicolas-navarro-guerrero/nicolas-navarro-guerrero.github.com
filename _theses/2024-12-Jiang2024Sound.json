		"abstract": "This study proposes a multimodal neural network-based method for sound source localization on a bionic robotic hand. Using vibration signals treated via processing, including convolutional neural networks, the method achieves centimeter-level accuracy without relying on traditional vibration modeling. The results demonstrate the feasibility of this method while highlighting challenges like interference and generalization.",
