		"abstract": "In this article a time synchronisation protocol is developed. This protocol intents on creating a high accuracy and power efficient time synchronisation method. The protocol implements a simple solution in order to minimize the time the sensors must stay in receiving mode. The rational behind the protocol is to ensure that data is correctly time-stamped and time-relevant int in order to optimise a control loop managing building and factories resources. The protocol outperforms the state of the art protocols in terms of time accuracy and energy consumption.",
