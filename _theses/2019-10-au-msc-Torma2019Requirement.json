		"abstract": "We hypothesize that by manipulating the gender cues in a person’s voice, it could be possible to obtain a gender-ambiguous voice. By masking the voice-gender, we aim to increase unbiasedness and fairness in human–robot interactions, especially in decision-making scenarios. For this, we examined male and female voices to conclude numerical data that could characterise a gender-ambiguous voice. Including our findings and conclusions, we attempted to provide language-independent guidelines of requirements for a voice-gender masking application. We selected the voice features that are important in the gender perception in a voice. After we concluded the gender ambiguous targets, we analysed and manipulated adult speech recordings and examined how the applied modifications affect each other. During the thesis work, we identified that the fundamental frequency and speaking fundamental frequency (i.e. pitch), the formant frequencies (i.e. timbre) and the phonation types (breathiness and creakiness) are important in the gender perception in voices.",
