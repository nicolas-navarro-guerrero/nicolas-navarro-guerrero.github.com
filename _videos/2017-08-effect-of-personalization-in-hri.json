title: "The Impact of Personalisation on Human-Robot Interaction in Learning Scenarios"
description: "This video presents an interaction scenario, realised using the Neuro-Inspired Companion (NICO) robot. NICO engages the users in a personalised conversation where the robot always tracks the users' face, remembers them and interacts with them using natural language. NICO can also learn to perform tasks such as remembering and recalling objects and thus can assist users in their daily chores. The interaction system helps the users to interact as naturally as possible with the robot, enriching their experience with the robot, making it more interesting and engaging. The video presents the different methodologies used to implement the interaction scenario and their interplay. It then presents the NICO robot interacting with a user and using its visual and auditory capabilities to engage the user in an interesting and engaging conversation."
