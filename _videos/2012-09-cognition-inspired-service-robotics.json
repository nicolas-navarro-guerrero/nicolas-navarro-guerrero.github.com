title: "Cognition Inspired Service Robotics"
description: "We present a novel framework for robot mobile behaviour based on cognitive learning. Our approach builds up a cognitive map (Yan et al., 2012) that learns a sensorimotor representation and the salient visual features of an environment through exploratory navigation. The robot can find the position of a target object by comparing the features of the object with the appearance of the location in the map and navigate efficiently and robustly through a home-like environment. A vision-based docking model is trained with reinforcement learning that aligns the robot accurately to the object (Navarro-Guerrero et al., 2012). A SOM-based grasping model is executed after the docking phase to grasp the object so that it can be carried to the user. Overall, we demonstrate and test our system on a real-world object fetching scenario."
