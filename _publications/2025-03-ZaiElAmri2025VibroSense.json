		"abstract": "Tactile sensors are crucial for many robotic applications, such as dexterous robotic gripping, prosthetics, and surgical robots. However, only a few companies offer this type of sensor. Additionally, these sensors are too expensive and fragile to be used in many applications. We are developing a vibration-based tactile sensor integrated into a robotic hand as a demonstration. We focus on improving machine learning algorithms for texture recognition, object detection, and localization of touch stimuli using body-borne vibrations, creating a more efficient and cost-effective solution for diverse applications such as robotics. We are transferring the technology to a start-up developing robotics hands and grippers.",
