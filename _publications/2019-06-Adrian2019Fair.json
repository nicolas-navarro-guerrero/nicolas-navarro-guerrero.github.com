		"abstract": "Numerous studies expect negative effects of computerization by artificial intelligence and automation by robots on employment (Ford, 2015; Frey & Osborne, 2017). With advances in big data analytics and sensors even non‐routine cognitive and manual tasks might be assumed by computers and robots in the future (Frey & Osborne, 2017). Tasks that require capabilities in creativity or social interaction (Frey & Osborne, 2017) and therefore empathy (Allen & Wallach, 2012), however, are harder to take over by machines.",
