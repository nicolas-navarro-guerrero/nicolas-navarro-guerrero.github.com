    "abstract": "Classical fear conditioning has experienced a growing interest over the last decade. Fear learning mechanisms are a simple and robust learning paradigm that involves sensory and motor areas. We believe that a deeper study of these mechanisms will contribute not only to a better understanding of fear conditioning but also to the development of future robot generations.",
