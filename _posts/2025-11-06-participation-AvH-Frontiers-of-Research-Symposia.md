The Alexander von Humboldt Foundation regularly convenes bi- and tri-national Frontiers of Research Symposia in cooperation with its partner organizations in Brazil, China, Japan, India, Israel, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America.

The Frontiers of Research Symposia provide outstanding young researchers from Germany and partner countries with a platform for an international and interdisciplinary knowledge exchange. The participating researchers establish or strengthen connections with other future thought leaders, often pioneering innovative fields for collaboration. Participants question and expand the boundaries of their respective disciplines – for example, through cross-disciplinary discussions of current advancements, innovative research, and emerging opportunities. The German Federal Ministry of Research, Technology, and Space supports the Frontiers of Research program.

Up to 60 researchers from engineering and the applied natural sciences meet every year to challenge the boundaries of their fields. Nominated and funded by CAPES and the Humboldt Foundation, they establish new collaborations across their disciplines.
