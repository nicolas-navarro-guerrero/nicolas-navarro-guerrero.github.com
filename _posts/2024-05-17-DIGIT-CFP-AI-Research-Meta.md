<p>We've just received the five fully assembled DIGIT sensors we were awarded by AI at Meta, in partnership with GelSight Inc. The DIGIT sensor is a high-resolution vision-based tactile sensor. With this program, AI at Meta aims to provide a low-cost yet reliable and readily available hardware platform for touch sensing, enable scientific breakthroughs in real-world applications (e.g., robotics), encourage research in touch as a sensor modality and tactile sensors, and develop reusable components and tools.</p>

<p>We thank AI at Meta and GelSight for the support.</p>
