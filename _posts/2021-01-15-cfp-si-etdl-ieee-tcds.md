This special issue will include state-of-the-art research on emerging topics on development and learning in natural and artificial systems. In addition to new submissions, papers presented at ICDL-EpiRob 2020 will be invited to submit extended versions to the special issue. All submissions, including those that are based on ICDL-EpiRob 2020 papers, will be reviewed as regular TCDS papers.

This special issue has a focus on development and learning from a multidisciplinary perspective gathering researchers from computer science, robotics, psychology, and developmental studies. We invite researchers to share knowledge and research on how humans and animals develop sensing, reasoning and actions, and how to exploit robots as research tools to test models of development and learning. We expect the submitted contributions emphasize the interaction with social and physical environments and how cognitive and developmental capabilities can be transferred to computing systems and robotics. This approach goes hand in hand with the goals of both understanding human and animal development and applying this knowledge to improve future intelligent technology, including for robots that will be in close interaction with humans.
