<p>I am a Research and Teaching Associate at the Department of Computer Science at the University of Hamburg (Germany).</p>
<!--more-->
<p>I received a degree in Electronic Engineering from the Universidad Técnica Federico Santa María, Valparaíso, Chile, in 2010. I specialized in embedded systems and applied artificial intelligence and robotics. In 2016 I completed a Ph.D. on Computer Science at the University of Hamburg (Germany). My Ph.D. research concerned computational models for adaptive robot behaviour based on neural mechanisms of self-preservation.</p>

<p>Vast experience on applied robotic and automation research in Chile and Germany. Proven experience conceptualizing project proposals for diverse funding agencies such as the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA), the European Union's Programme for Information and Communication Technologies (ICT), the European Research Council (ERC), the German Research Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft - DFG), the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF), and to German and Chilean academic funds and both private and governmental venture funds in Chile.</p>

<p hidden>From June 2010 until May 2013, I was a beneficiary of Marie Curie Initial Training Network Fellowship (<a href="http://robotdoc.org/">The RobotDoC Collegium</a>) and worked as an Early-Stage Researcher at the Department of Computer Science at the University of Hamburg (Germany) under the supervision of <a href="https://www.informatik.uni-hamburg.de/~wermter/">Prof. Stefan Wermter.</a></p>
