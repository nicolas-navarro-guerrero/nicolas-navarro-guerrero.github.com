<p>Nicolás is a Research and Teaching Associate at the Department of Computer Science at the University of Hamburg (Germany).</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Nicolás received a degree in Electronic Engineering from the Universidad Técnica Federico Santa María, Valparaíso, Chile, in 2010. He specialized in embedded systems and applied artificial intelligence and robotics. Thrive in dynamic, multidisciplinary and challenging environments. Excellent technical abilities and enjoy the challenge of continually learning and developing custom automation solutions. Thorough and well organized.</p>

<p>Vast experience on applied robotic and automation research in Chile and Germany. Proven experience conceptualizing project proposals for diverse funding agencies such as Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA), European Union's Programme for Information and Communication Technologies (ICT), German Research Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft - DFG), to German and Chilean academic funds and both private and governmental venture funds in Chile.</p>

<p hidden>Since June 2010, I am a beneficiary of Marie Curie Initial Training Network Fellowship (<a href="http://robotdoc.org/">The RobotDoC Collegium</a>) and work as an Early-Stage Researcher at the Department of Computer Science at the University of Hamburg (Germany) under the supervision of <a href="https://www.informatik.uni-hamburg.de/~wermter/">Prof. Stefan Wermter.</a></p>

<p hidden>I have worked on and done research in several fields such as system automation, mobile robotics, artificial intelligence, neural network and artificial vision systems. My research interests include artificial intelligence, cognitive robotics, embodied cognition, hybrid artificial intelligence systems, applied artificial intelligence and robotics, embedded systems and mechatronics.</p>

<p hidden>My current research focuses on the modeling of affective mechanism. I based my architecture on I based my architecture on neural circuitry linked to	mammalian behavioural responses, for more information visit <a href="/projects/robotdoc/">this link</a>. Our aim is to contribute in the understanding of cognitive processes generating model based theory of cognition and contribute to the development of next robot generation.</p>
