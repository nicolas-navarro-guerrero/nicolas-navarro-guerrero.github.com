<p>I am an Assistant Professor at the Department of Engineering and the School of Culture and Society at Aarhus University (Denmark).</p>
<!--more-->
<p>I received a degree in Electronic Engineering from the Universidad Técnica Federico Santa María, Valparaíso, Chile, in 2010. I specialised in embedded systems and applied artificial intelligence and robotics. In 2016 I completed a Ph.D. in Computer Science at the University of Hamburg (Germany). My Ph.D. research concerned computational models for adaptive robot behaviour based on neural mechanisms of self-preservation.</p>

<p>Since my electronic engineering studies, then working in industry first as student assistance in parallel to my studies and later as an engineer, I have been involved in automation and robotic projects where I have learned about both hardware and software development and developed an outstanding technical and scientific skill set. I enjoy the challenge of continually learning and developing custom automation and robotics solutions in dynamic and multidisciplinary environments. I am thorough and well organised.</p>

<p>In my professional career, I have actively developed my hard and soft skills. Within my hard skills, I can include the development of printed circuit boards (PCBs) with Protel, Altium and Eagle Cad, production of PCBs with semi-industrial equipment, soldering of PCBs, worked on cleanrooms, and programming both modern computers as well as embedded devices such as microcontrollers, DSPs, PLCs and FPGAs. Within my soft skills, I have coordinated the mechatronic design of mobile robots for the difficult task of humanitarian demining. More recently, I have been leading the development of the API for a humanoid robot for human-robot interaction. I also have vast experience on applied robotic and automation research in Chile and Germany. Proven experience conceptualizing project proposals for diverse funding agencies such as the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA), the European Union's Programme for Information and Communication Technologies (ICT), the European Research Council (ERC), the German Research Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft - DFG), the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF), and to German and Chilean academic funds and both private and governmental venture funds in Chile.</p>
