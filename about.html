<p>I am a Senior Researcher at the Robotics Innovation Center at the German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence GmbH (Bremen, Germany).</p>
<!--more-->
<p>I received a degree in Electronic Engineering from the Universidad Técnica Federico Santa María, Valparaíso, Chile, in 2010. I specialised in embedded systems and applied artificial intelligence. In 2016 I completed a Ph.D. in Computer Science at the University of Hamburg (Germany). My Ph.D. research concerned computational models for adaptive robot behaviour based on neural mechanisms of self-preservation.</p>

<p>Since my electronic engineering studies, then working in the industry as student assistance in parallel to my studies and later as an engineer, I have been involved in automation and robotic projects. I have learned about both hardware and software development and developed my technical and scientific skill set. I enjoy the challenge of continually learning and developing custom automation and robotics solutions in dynamic and multidisciplinary environments. I am thorough and well organised.</p>

<p>In my professional career, I have actively developed my hard and soft skills. Within my hard skills, I can include the development of printed circuit boards (PCBs) with Protel, Altium and Eagle Cad, production of PCBs, soldering of PCBs, worked on cleanrooms, and programming both modern computers as well as embedded devices such as microcontrollers, DSPs, PLCs and FPGAs. Within my soft skills, I have coordinated the mechatronic design of mobile robots for the difficult task of humanitarian demining. More recently, I have been leading the development of the API for a humanoid robot for human-robot interaction. I also have vast experience in applied robotics and automation research in Chile and Germany. I have proven experience in conceptualising project proposals for diverse funding agencies.</p>
